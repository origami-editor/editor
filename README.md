# flutter-editor
Origami is going to be a comprehensive set of development tools and editing software for dahliaOS and other operating systems running Flutter. 
# Features
Ideally, Origami will support remote deployment to dahliaOS machines, including hot reload, replicating amberctl on Fuchsia. It should also support dap signing and building, although that might be built into a custom SDK in the future.
